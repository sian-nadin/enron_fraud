# Enron Fraud detection

Machine learning model for identifying persons-of-interest (POI) from Enron data.

## Overview
In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives.

The purpose of this project was to use various machine learning algorithms for identifying POIs, namely company insiders possibly involved in financial fraud at the now shuttered Enron Corporation.

The project covers the entire exploratory data analysis (EDA) scope and most of the meat of the analysis and code can be found in the Enron Fraud.ipynb file.

The project was completed as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program.
